With 2018 now in the books, it's time to look back at what YOU thought were the best games of the year. Before we get into the results, a few small housekeeping items: There will probably be results you don't like. Be civil. This was an open process. The community decided the categories (https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/a4vuau/2018_rnintendoswitch_goty_award_category_feedback/), the nominees for each category (https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/a. 
And finally, we come to the end of the new run of Torments. We can probably expect these to hang around for a good while, and more Rubies will eventually be available in the new periodic Torment-training events we'll get later. Dr. Mog has also seen fit to gift us a new ability to help complete this content. Instead of Bonds of Historia, you can now choose to pick Rejuvenation Grimoire as your summon, which is an instant cast medica that heals 100% of Max HP. Be aware that the heal is capped. ###Build Help/Ready: Have you read the sidebar and rules ( (Please do) Yes. What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better. Gaming, streaming, personal use. Currently use an old HP laptop for PC gaming, and I can't do it anymore. If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings) Not sure exactly, I'm not familiar with performance specs. Anything that's. </p>
